This is a repository containing the API and sample games for the multi-screen games project.

HOW TO PLAY

Go to the Network module in Processing and change the MAIN_SERVER_IP 
variable to be the IP you will run the server on. Launch an instance of 
the executable on the server machine and press the 's' key to start the 
server running. Then, for MSPong, start up four other instances on whatever 
computer you want and press 'c' to start it up as a client. For MSTanks, 
just start up two. In MSPong, the controls are WASD and up, down, left, 
right for each paddle. In MSTanks, the controls are WASD to move your tank's 
area, up and down to change your angle, and spacebar to shoot.
